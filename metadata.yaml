description: "East Lynne is an English sensation novel of 1861 by Ellen Wood. A Victorian\
  \ bestseller, it is remembered chiefly for its elaborate and implausible plot, centring\
  \ on infidelity and double identities. There have been numerous stage and film adaptations.\n\
  The much-\"quoted\" line \"Gone! And never called me mother!\" (variant: \"Dead!\
  \ Dead! And never called me mother!\") does not appear in the book; both variants\
  \ come from later stage adaptations.\nThe book was originally serialised in The\
  \ New Monthly Magazine between January 1860 and September 1861, being issued as\
  \ a three-volume novel on 19 September 1861.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
